This program is Python code. It is using tree-based model to predict the label 'playtime_forever'.

You can just run this code main.py directly (using Random Forest Regression model) or choose another model from model.py. You will get a (.csv) file which contains the predict data, you can also upload this file to Kaggle directly.
